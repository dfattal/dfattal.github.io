# How to Use the WebXR 3D Video Player

Here are the instructions for viewing your stereoscopic 3D videos in our WebXR player.

## 1. Video Requirements (Important!)

For the 3D effect to work correctly, your video file must be:
*   **Format**: Full-width, Side-by-Side (SBS) 3D.
*   **Convergence**: Converged at infinity. This means that objects in the far distance should appear in the same horizontal position in both the left and right eye views.

## 2. Getting Started

1.  **Open the Link**: Navigate to the player URL in a WebXR-compatible browser (like Chrome, Edge, or the Meta Quest Browser).
2.  **Load Your Video**: Drag and drop your video file onto the page or click the designated area to select a file.
3.  **Enter VR**: Click the "Enter VR" button and put on your headset. Audio will play automatically in VR.

## 3. Controls Inside VR

You can use either VR controllers or hand tracking.

### Using a VR Controller:
*   **Move Screen Closer/Farther**: Push the **Left Thumbstick** forward or backward.
*   **Zoom In/Out**: Push the **Right Thumbstick** forward or backward. Adjust this to match your camera's original field of view to ensure objects look the correct size.
*   **Play/Pause**: Press the **A Button** (right controller).
*   **Show/Hide Info**: Press the **B Button** (right controller).
*   **Exit VR**: Press the **X Button** (left controller).

### Using Hand Tracking:
*   **Zoom In/Out**: Pinch with your **Right Hand** and drag left or right.
*   **Play/Pause**: Give a quick pinch-tap with your **Right Hand**.
*   **Exit VR**: Quickly pinch-tap twice with your **Left Hand**.
