## üìã Permissions Justification

**For Chrome Web Store Review Team:**

### `activeTab`
- **Purpose**: Access current webpage to inject 2D3D conversion buttons
- **Justification**: Core functionality requires DOM manipulation to add buttons to images
- **Scope**: Only active tab, only when user activates extension

### `storage`
- **Purpose**: Remember user's enable/disable preference
- **Justification**: Prevents having to re-enable extension on every page load
- **Data Stored**: Boolean preference only, no personal data

### `host_permissions` (Immersity AI domains)
- **Purpose**: Communicate with 3D conversion API
- **Justification**: Core functionality requires external AI service for image processing
- **Data Sent**: Only user-selected images for conversion
