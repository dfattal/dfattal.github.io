# Privacy Policy for ImmersityLens Chrome Extension

**Last Updated**: December 2024

## Overview
ImmersityLens is a Chrome extension that converts 2D images into immersive 3D Light Field Images (LIF) using artificial intelligence. This privacy policy explains how we handle data when you use our extension.

## Data Collection
**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

The extension operates with the following privacy principles:
- No user accounts or registration required
- No personal data collection
- No tracking or analytics
- No data sharing with third parties (except for necessary image processing)

## Image Processing
When you choose to convert an image to 3D:

### What Happens to Your Images
- Images are processed using the Immersity AI service for 3D conversion
- Images are only sent for processing when you explicitly click the "2D3D" button
- No images are permanently stored by our extension
- Images are not shared with any third parties beyond the conversion service
- The conversion service processes images temporarily and does not retain them

### User Control
- All image processing is initiated by your direct action
- You can choose which images to convert
- No automatic or background image processing occurs

## Local Storage
The extension stores minimal data locally in your browser:

### What We Store
- Your extension preference (enabled/disabled state)
- CORS information display status (whether you've seen the CORS help popup)

### What We Don't Store
- No images or image data
- No personal information
- No browsing history
- No website data

## Third-Party Services

### Immersity AI
- We use Immersity AI's service for 2D to 3D image conversion
- Images are sent to their servers only when you request conversion

### No Other Third Parties
- We do not integrate with any other third-party services
- No advertising networks or analytics services
